            <h1>
                Google Design's best of 2020
            </h1>
            <h3>
                A look back at the year’s most resilient design projects
            </h3>
            <p>
                When we left our desks back in March, we didn’t think twice about leaving our office plants and reading glasses behind. Days became weeks, weeks stretched to months. (We eventually said goodbye to the fiddle leaf figs). Soon we were sharing tips on how to work together while apart, and recognizing a fundamental shift in the way we work. The resiliency of our Google colleagues was never in doubt, but this year we saw them flex and adapt in exciting new directions, all while meeting people where they are (usually at home), to deliver experiences that made us feel more connected, informed, and optimistic than ever. Most of the work we reviewed for this year’s annual revue was created remotely, during a global pandemic, and is shaped by that context. And yet, we think you’ll find that the noteworthy projects—including crowdsourced earthquake alerts and variable fonts—add up to a stellar year for UX at Google. As we look ahead to 2021 (praise be!) take a minute to applaud the work and the people who made 2020 sing.

                    At last, the power of interpolation that font designers have been using for years is available in standard applications, and is in the hands of everyone. This new breed of fonts can be finely adjusted by eye or by automation, just once for a simple document or many times per second for live interaction and animation.
